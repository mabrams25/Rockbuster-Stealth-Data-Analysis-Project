# Rockbuster-Stealth-Data-Analysis-Project

Project is based on movie rental data from a company called Rockbuster Stealth LLC

# Primary Objectives

* Write moderately complex SQL queries to answer business questions:
  1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain? 
  2. What was the average rental duration for all videos? 
  3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in? 
  4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based? 
  5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions? 
* Present SQL results to business managers by creative storytelling using PowerPoint and visualizations from Tableau
* Present SQL results to technical colleagues using Excel and by creating a data dictionary

# Rockbuster Data Sets and Data Dictionary

Here this folder contains all Rockbuster data sets and a data dictionary that I've written:
```

Data Dictionary (Rockbuster Stealth LLC) .pdf        # A data dictionary containing an Entity Relationship Diagram and all tables that share links to other tables
```

# Queries

Here are some of the queries that I've written to answer business questions mentioned above:
```
Query 1: Date of Payment                             # A SQL query returning customer information regarding their date of movie rental purchase
Query 2: Average Duration Per Rating                 # A SQL query returning the average duration in days for each movie rating
Query 3: Revenue by Genre                            # A SQL query returning how much revenue was earned for each movie genre
Query 4: Total Revenue Country                       # A SQL query returning how much revenue was earned for each country
Query 5: Total Revenue Country & City                # A SQL query returning how much revenue was earned grouped by country and city
Query 6: Top 10 Countries By Revenue CTE             # A SQL query using CTE returning the top 10 countries by highest revenue earned
Query 7: Top 10 Countries By Customer CTE            # A SQL query using CTE returning the top 10 countries by highest customer count
Query 8: Top 5 Customers From Top 10 Countries       # A SQL query returning the top 5 customers based off from the top 10 countries
Query 9: Average Amount Paid by Top 5 Customers CTE  # A SQL query using CTE returning the top 5 customers based off from the top 10 countries 
```
